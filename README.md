# Text Recognizer Pro 

This project is from the Full Stack Deep Learning Spring 2021 Labs.

We will incrementally develop a complete deep learning codebase to understand the content of handwritten paragraphs.

So in this project we will do the following:
- Use the modern stack of PyTorch and PyTorch-Ligtning.
- Use the main workhorses of DL today: CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
- Manage our experiments using Weights & Biases.
- Set up continuous integration system for our codebase using CircleCI.
- Package up the prediction system as a REST API using FastAPI, and deploy it as a Docker container on AWS Lambda.
- Set up monitoring that alerts us when the incoming data distribution changes.
